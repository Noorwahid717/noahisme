fix: prevent layout shift in Role Rotator animation

## Problem
Subheadline was shifting position during typing animation because
role text width changed dynamically as characters typed/erased.

## Solution
Implement fixed-width container for role text based on longest string:
- "Frontend Specialist" = 20 characters (longest)
- Container width: 11.5em (mobile), 10em (tablet), 9.5em (desktop)
- Responsive width adjustment on window resize

## Technical Changes

Modified: src/components/HeroStatic.astro

1. Added role-container wrapper with inline styles:
   style="width: 11.5em; min-width: 11.5em; text-align: left;"

2. Enhanced JavaScript with dynamic width adjustment:
   - updateContainerWidth() function
   - Resize event listener
   - Responsive breakpoints (640px, 768px)

3. Separated cursor from role-text for better control

## Result
✅ No layout shift during typing/erasing
✅ Subheadline stays fixed in position
✅ Smooth animation across all screen sizes
✅ Professional, polished appearance

Build: Success (7.35s)
Testing: Verified on mobile, tablet, desktop sizes
